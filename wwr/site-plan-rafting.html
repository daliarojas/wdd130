    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The primary purpose of the Utah Rapids Rafting website is to provide information about our rafting company and
      what our company has to offer.
      To provide a pleasant browsing experience to the visitor for research of available short and long rafting
      excursions for individuals or groups.
      They will also be able to find answers to common questions and contact us to schedule an excursion.</p>
    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our target audience is younger individuals or groups that are interested in high adventure type activities as
      well as families looking for fun, safe, vacation activities.
      We provide a one time service for individuals that are interested in a safe rafting adventure but don't want to
      pay the money, or have the space, to outfit themselves with rafting equipment long term at this point</p>
